#  Mobile Phone Data Analysis & Hypothesis Testing

##  Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing a mobile phone dataset to extract meaningful business insights using **data analysis, visualization, and statistical hypothesis testing**. The analysis helps understand how different features impact mobile phone pricing and supports data-driven decision making.

---

##  Business Problem

With hundreds of mobile phone models available in the market, it becomes challenging to identify the key factors that influence pricing. This project aims to:

* Analyze mobile phone features
* Identify pricing patterns
* Validate assumptions using statistical tests

---

##  Dataset Summary

* **Total Records:** 683 mobile phones
* **Data Type:** Structured tabular data
* **Key Features:** Brand, selling price, specifications, and other attributes

---

##  Data Cleaning

* Handled missing and inconsistent values
* Removed duplicates
* Ensured correct data types
* Prepared clean data for analysis and modeling

---

##  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

###  Univariate Analysis

* Distribution of selling prices
* Feature-wise frequency analysis
* Insights derived from individual variables

###  Bivariate Analysis

* Relationship between price and other features
* Comparative analysis across brands and categories

---

##  Data Visualization

* Bar charts
* Histograms
* Box plots
* Comparative plots for better interpretation of trends and outliers

---

##  Hypothesis Testing

The following statistical tests were performed to validate assumptions:

###  Hypothesis 1 – Independent T-Test

* Tested price differences between two independent groups
* **Result:** Statistically significant insight obtained

###  Hypothesis 2 – One-Way ANOVA

* Compared mean prices across multiple groups
* **Result:** Significant variation observed among groups

###  Hypothesis 3 – Independent T-Test

* Additional comparison to support business conclusions
* **Result:** Hypothesis validated with strong evidence

---

##  Key Analysis Insights

* Brand and specifications have a strong influence on selling price
* Certain categories show significant price variation
* Statistical tests confirm observed patterns in data

---

##  Key Recommendations

* Focus on high-impact features while pricing mobile phones
* Use statistical validation before making pricing strategies
* Brands can optimize models based on customer demand trends

---

##  Conclusion

This project demonstrates how **data analysis combined with hypothesis testing** can uncover valuable insights from real-world datasets. The findings support informed decision-making and showcase practical applications of data analytics techniques.
